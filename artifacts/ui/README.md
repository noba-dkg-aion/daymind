# DayMind UI Snapshots

This folder keeps designer-ready screenshots generated by `scripts/ui_snapshot.py`.

- `latest/` – throwaway captures from the most recent polish pass.
- `reference/` – the “golden” set used for visual diffs each sprint. Copy the approved PNGs here (and optionally suffix the filenames with the sprint tag).

Every snapshot should include a short note (device, resolution, git commit) in this file or the release ticket so we can trace regressions quickly. Do not commit the binary PNGs themselves unless requested; attach them to release PRs or store them in the artifact bucket referenced in `AGILE_PLAN.md`.
